# quackbox
common functions used on particle distributions (in the context of hydrodynamical simulations)

Containing: 
- rotations for particle distributions (quaternion based)
- half (or any percentile) radius calculations (spherical and elliptical)
- shape measurements (moment of inertia tensor, reduced moment of inertia tensor)
- velocity anisotropy
- arbitrary shape sampling
- periodic box wrapping
- code unit to physical unit conversion
- angular momentum calculation
