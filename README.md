# quackbox
general functions for use with particle distributions. (developed from use with hydro sims)

Containing: 
- rotations for particle distributions (quaternion based)
- half (or any percentile) radius calculations (spherical and elliptical)
- shape measurements (moment of inertia tensor, reduced moment of inertia tensor)
- velocity anisotropy
- arbitrary shape sampling
