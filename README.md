# sdss_CNN

Convolutional neural network for predicting a galaxy's spin based on SDSS photometry (RGB images).

This directory using kinematic information from [MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/), along with photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ([SDSS](https://classic.sdss.org/dr7/)), to train a convolutional neural network to predict a galaxy's spin.
